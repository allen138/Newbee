New In Town?
Looking for some Entertainment, but don't know where to look?

Look no further...

Newbee App lets you find events near you!

Easily search local sporting events, concerts, and comedy shows within your current location. Select the categorie(s) your interested and hit the "GO" button. Newbee will generate a list of events in your area!

Find an event you like and when you click on it, that event will be saved to "My Events". 

In "My Events" you can easily track the events your interested in and find tickets by clicking the link to the right of the event. 

Now get out there and have some fun!
